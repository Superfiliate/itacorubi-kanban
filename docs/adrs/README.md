# Architecture Decision Records

This folder contains accepted architectural decisions for the project.

## Format

ADRs should follow this structure:

```markdown
# ADR 001: Short Title

One-liner stating the decision clearly.

- Key reason or context
- Trade-off considered
- Important consequence

## Examples (optional)

Code snippets when helpful.
```

## Scope

ADRs are for technical/architectural decisions and patterns (how we build). Product behavior/UX belongs in `/docs/features/`.

## Guidelines

- Be succinct and decision-oriented
- Add small examples/cheatsheets when they clarify the pattern; avoid long dumps
- Place examples under a `## Examples` section when present
- Prioritize the most important points
- All ADRs in this folder are accepted (no status needed)
