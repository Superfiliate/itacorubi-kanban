# ADR 015: Testing Setup

We use Playwright for end-to-end testing of high-level user flows.

- **E2E testing only** - Focus on testing complete user workflows, not individual component interactions
- **Playwright** - Single tool for all E2E testing needs
- **Test database isolation** - Each test run uses a separate `test.db` file
- **Real browser testing** - Tests run in actual Chromium browsers

## Hard Rules (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Never skip tests** - No `test.skip()`, `test.fixme()`, or any skipping mechanism. If a test can't be made reliable, delete it entirely.
2. **Flaky tests are bugs** - If a test is unreliable in our controlled test environment, the underlying code is unreliable for users too. Fix it.
3. **No overlapping tests** - If two tests cover the same scenario with minor variations, merge them or keep only one.
4. **Speed matters** - Tests run in parallel. Slow tests block iteration. Optimize aggressively.

## Flaky Failures vs Hard Failures

Retries help distinguish failure types. Both are bugs requiring different debugging approaches:

| Failure Type | Behavior | Debugging Approach |
|--------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Flaky** | Fails initially, passes on retry | Race conditions, timing issues, async patterns, missing waits |
| **Hard** | Fails all retries | Logic bugs, broken selectors, missing elements, real regressions |

## Test Organization

All Playwright tests and utilities are located in the `playwright/` directory:

```
playwright/
├── playwright.config.ts       # Playwright configuration
├── global-setup.ts            # Database reset before all tests
├── board-creation.spec.ts     # Board creation flow tests
├── board-unlock.spec.ts       # Board unlock/access flow tests
├── task-management.spec.ts    # Task CRUD operations tests
├── comments.spec.ts           # Comments flow tests
├── contributors.spec.ts       # Contributors management tests
├── columns.spec.ts            # Columns management tests
└── utils/
    ├── db.ts                  # Database helper utilities
    └── playwright.ts          # Playwright test helpers
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in UI mode (interactive)
pnpm test:ui

# Run tests in debug mode
pnpm test:debug

# Run specific test file
pnpm test playwright/board-creation.spec.ts
```

## Test Database

- Tests use a separate `test.db` file (not `local.db`)
- Database is reset before all tests run via `global-setup.ts`
- The build step automatically initializes the database with `pnpm db:push`
- Environment variable `TURSO_DATABASE_URL=file:test.db` is set for test runs

## Configuration

The Playwright config (`playwright/playwright.config.ts`) includes:

- **Test server**: Automatically builds and starts Next.js production server on port 5800
- **Test database**: Uses `file:test.db` via environment variable
- **Browser**: Chromium only
- **Retries**: 2 retries (for flakiness detection, not to hide bugs)
- **Screenshots/Videos**: Captured on failure for debugging
- **Parallel execution**: Enabled (`fullyParallel: true`) with multiple workers
- **Timeouts**: All timeouts configured globally (no per-test overrides allowed):
  - `timeout: 30000` - 30 seconds maximum per test
  - `expect.timeout: 10000` - 10 seconds for assertions
  - `actionTimeout: 10000` - 10 seconds for actions
  - `navigationTimeout: 10000` - 10 seconds for navigation

## Avoiding Overlapping Tests

Before adding a new test, ask:

1. **Does an existing test already cover this?** If yes, don't add a new one.
2. **Is this a minor variation of an existing test?** If yes, merge it into the existing test.
3. **Would users actually hit this scenario?** If it's a theoretical edge case, skip it.

**Example - Password Change Feature:**

Good (2 tests):
- Happy path: change password, verify success, stays logged in
- Security: old password fails after change, new password works

Avoid (8+ separate tests):
- Cancel button, empty validation, mismatch validation, redirect scenarios, etc.

## Best Practices

1. **Use semantic selectors** - Prefer `getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText` over CSS selectors
2. **Wait for elements** - Use Playwright's auto-waiting, avoid manual `sleep()` calls
3. **Test user flows** - Focus on what users do, not implementation details
4. **Keep tests independent** - Each test should work in isolation
5. **No explicit timeouts** - Always use global timeout configuration

## Known Limitations

Some scenarios cannot be reliably tested with Playwright's synthetic events:

- **Drag-and-drop file uploads** - Synthetic drop events don't trigger ProseMirror/Tiptap's event handlers reliably. The toolbar upload button is tested instead.
- **Complex editor interactions** - Some rich text editor behaviors require real browser events that can't be synthesized.

These are documented here rather than kept as skipped tests.

## Gotchas (Lessons Learned)

These are recurring root causes behind timeouts/flaky E2E tests. Check these first when debugging.

### Selector collisions (Playwright strict mode)

- Scope queries to a container:
  - Example: `const sidebar = page.getByRole("dialog", { name: /edit task/i })`
  - Then query within it: `sidebar.getByRole("combobox", { name: /assignees/i })`
- Avoid `getByText(/foo/i)` when the same text can appear in multiple places
- Disambiguate with `.first()` / `.nth()` or a more specific role-based locator

### Accessibility drives testability

We rely on `getByRole(..., { name })` heavily. That requires proper accessible names.

- Icon-only buttons must have `aria-label` (and ideally `title`)
- Custom combobox triggers must have an accessible name via `aria-label` or associated `<label>`

### Escape key closes the wrong layer

`Escape` can close popovers/menus (desired) or the whole sidebar (undesired), depending on focus.

- Prefer closing via explicit UI controls (e.g. `Back` button) instead of `page.keyboard.press("Escape")`
- Close selection popovers after selecting/creating items to avoid needing Escape

### Optimistic updates should keep stable identities

If the UI swaps an optimistic entity ID for a server ID, it can detach nodes Playwright is interacting with.

- Create entities with deterministic IDs when possible (client generates, server accepts)
- If replacement is unavoidable, ensure the UI remains stable during critical interactions

### Drag and drop needs explicit handles

For DnD (dnd-kit):
- Provide a dedicated drag handle button with listeners
- Don't attach drag listeners to large interactive regions
- Use pointer-based dragging that matches the app's sensor/activation constraints
