# Documentation

This folder contains project documentation organized into distinct categories for different purposes.

## Folder Structure

### `/adrs` - Architecture Decision Records

Technical/architectural decisions and patterns (how we build). Keep concise rationale plus small examples/cheatsheets. Do NOT capture product behavior or UX here.

**What to store here:**

- Coding style guidelines
- Architectural patterns and decisions
- Technology choices and rationale
- Code organization conventions
- Naming conventions

### `/features` - Feature Documentation

Product/UX requirements and design directions (what the product should do/look like). Include user flows, behavior, and visual guidance. Avoid deep implementation specifics; those live in ADRs.

**What to store here:**

- User stories and use-cases
- User flow diagrams and descriptions
- Feature requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- UI/UX specifications

> **Note:** This documentation structure is designed to be consumed by both human developers and AI coding assistants for better context and consistency.
