# AI Agent Instructions

**MANDATORY: Before starting ANY task, you MUST read the `/docs` folder.**

## Required Steps

1. **ALWAYS** read `/docs/README.md` first
2. **ALWAYS** check `/docs/adrs/` for coding patterns and conventions
3. **ALWAYS** check `/docs/features/` for user flows and requirements
4. **ALWAYS** check `/docs/specs/` for active development instructions

## Non-Negotiable

- Do NOT proceed without consulting docs
- Do NOT ignore documented patterns
- Do NOT deviate from documented conventions
- Do NOT make assumptions when docs exist

**The `/docs` folder is your source of truth.**
